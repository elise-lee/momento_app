# Momento App
User companion app for facial recognition wearable.

**Abstract**: Users on ios and Android will be able to swipe on a deck of "unknown" faces. Swiping right on a face will allow a user to input a name to associate with the name. When the facial recognition weable sees this face again, it will display the name that the user previously inputted.
